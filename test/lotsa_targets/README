Directory to test Makefiles with large numbers of targets,
which maketool splits into multiple submenus in the Build menu.

To run the test with a different number of targets, do:

% make clean ; make -n NUM_TARGETS=nnn

then start maketool in this directory. This should be done
for the following values of NUM_TARGETS (expressed in terms
of the BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD define in main.c):

0
1
BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD-1
BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD
BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD+1
8
(6*BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD)-1
(6*BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD)
(6*BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD)+1
(6*BUILD_MENU_THRESHOLD)+8
