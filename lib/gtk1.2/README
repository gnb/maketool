This directory contains a subset of the GTK+ 1.2.10 source,
with a patch applied to make it more efficient for maketool's
purposes.  The code is not a part of maketool proper, and indeed
maketool will build and run without it (just slower).  The
code remains under the original GTK+ licence, see the file
COPYING.  Note in particular that this licence differs from
the licence under which maketool itself is distributed.
