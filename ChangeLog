	* [FEA] During builds, provide a summary in the statusbar of the number
	of errors and warnings encountered.
	* [FEA] Added warning recognition regexp for gas warnings on
	standard input.
	* [BUG] Double-clicking on errors in the output of parallel recursion
	by gmake -jN gets the right filename.
	* [BUG] Fixed a number of minor memleaks associated with changing

Tue Sep 30 03:00:40 2003  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.8

	* [FEA] Configures, builds and runs with GTK2.

	* [FEA] Added full online HTML help (English only).

	* [FEA] Implemented an abstraction for make programs.  Now handles GNU make
	(the default), BSD 4.4 pmake, Sun make, IRIX smake.  Selectable in Preferences
	window and saved to .maketoolrc.  All features abstracted, including -j,
	-k, -n, target listing, indenting directories for recursive makes.  About Make
	window shows blurb and logo from current make program.
	* [FEA] Removed the extract_targets script, it's logic is now implemented
	in per-make program C code.

	* [FEA] Window title shows full current working directory, normalised to $HOME
	(shown as ~/...) when possible.  Likewise top level log entry for opened log files.
	* [FEA] Summary line for start of recursive sub-makes shows the path relative
	to the current working directory.

	* [FEA] Added a Compile Options window, accessible from the Options button
	in the About window, which shows a bunch of information about filters,
	makefile systems, and make programs.
	* [FEA] Added a FilterSet abstraction whose sole purpose is to make the
	Compile Options window look more interesting.

	* [FEA] Make the Licence window wide enough to show the GPL without line wrap.

	* [FEA] Targets "all" and "clean" have accelerators.

	* [FEA] The standard targets list is now per-makesystem.

	* [FRA] Ported to IRIX.  Handle MIPSpro error and warning messages, including
	multiline ones.  Renamed task.h -> maketool_task.h to avoid conflict with
	IRIX <task.h>

	* [FEA] Loading .maketoolrc will detect old format and automatically upgrade
	the file, with a warning message and a backup copy.

	* [BUG] Fixed regression which broke summary mode.
	* [BUG] Fixed regex matching bug in pmake list targets code which broke
	targets.
	* [BUG] Fixed memleak when generating log entry filenames.
	* [BUG] Fixed minor compiler warnings.
	* [BUG] Fixed FMR in task_run() by delaying free of Task objects using
	a refcounting scheme.
	* [BUG] Fixed memleak of summarised log lines.
	* [BUG] Fixed bug where a Task object was leaked if it failed to spawn.
	* [BUG] Fixed bug where changing directory free()d the last_target string
	but did not forget the pointer or update the GUI.
	* [BUG] Lines which are highlighted because summarised in the log also appear
	that way in the print output.
	* [BUG] Fixed FMR in filter_target().
	* [BUG] When changing a directory fails, generate a statusbar message.
	* [BUG] Fixed bug which caused GTK assert failure message when a log record
	without a visible line in the log window was added to the log.
	* [BUG] Made generic recognition patterns more robust wrt whitespace.
	* [BUG] Build menu is limited in width as well as length to avoid automake
	Makefile blowing out the menu to huuuuge proportions.
	* [BUG] Fixed bug which SEGVed on startup with glib2's GPtrArray.

	* [NVC] Used aclocal.m4 the way it was supposed to be used.  It is now possible
	to run "autoconf" on a machine other than my development machine.
	* [NVC] The config.h.in file is now generated with autoheader.
	* [NVC] Configure emits a warning when falling back to gtk 1.2.
	* [NVC] Configure script figures out which OS-specific source to build.
	* [NVC] Updated to newer version of gettext.
	* [NVC] Do not autoconf when building the rpm.
	* [NVC] Reduced build time dependency on gmake & gcc.
	* [NVC] Centralised lists of editors and browsers.
	* [NVC] Reduce warnings on LP64 compilation models.
	* [NVC] Replaced the rpm: makefile target with the buildrpm script from ggcov.
	* [NVC] Replaced global variable current_dir with a function current_directory()
	which makes it easier to initialise.
	* [NVC] Improved configure-time detection of platform signal semantics.
	* [NVC] Store the current working directory in a global variable to minimise
	overhead of g_get_current_dir().
	* [NVC] Changed the ifdefs used to enable various OS-specific filters from
	#ifdef __sgi etc to using proper autoconf symbols.
	* [NVC] Configure now automatically detects whether "inline" works.
	* [NVC] Added and distributed an excludes file for diffing.


Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 2001  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.7
	* [FEA] There is now a GUI for choosing options to ./configure scripts when
	building a Makefile in directories which use autoconf.
	* [FEA] Added support for automake.
	* [FEA] Added a menu item to allow the user to manually rebuild the Makefile
	when using autoconf, automake or imake.
	* [FEA] Added menu items to run configure, run autoconf, etc.
	* [FEA] Added filters to recognise configure script's "creating" lines, so the user
	can double-click on those lines.
	* [FEA] The make_makefile program has been replaced, partly with in-process
	code, partly with several fixed Makefile fragments.  Automatically
	building the Makefile is now much cleaner and more reliable.
	* [FEA] In summarise mode, summarised lines are shown in a configurable colour,
	which defaults to a very light grey.  This shows where the "Compiling"
	etc lines are when there is lots of un-summarisable rubbish.
	* [FEA] Added support for summaries of cross-compilation and cross-linking.
	* [FEA] Japanese translation, thanks to SATO Satoru of the Japan GNOME Users Group.
	* [FEA] Added Czech translation (thanks to Vaclav Slavik).
	* [FEA] No longer depends on BSD signal semantics; instead BSD and SysV semantics
	are checked for at configure time.
	* [FEA] The binary RPM now depends on make.
	* [FEA] Add email address to Vendor: in spec file.
	* [FEA] Correct GNOME-like appearance and behaviour of buttons in dialogs.
	* [FEA] Considerable work on the documentation, which is not released yet.
	* [BUG] Widgets update (e.g. mouse-over animations) during help click-on sequence.
	* [BUG] Fixed bug which broke summaries of some compile lines.
	* [BUG] Improved failure mode when extract_targets is not found: a single
	insensitive menu entry is added, and the error output is shown to
	the user in the message bar.
	* [BUG] Work around problem with mouse-over highlights of toolbar "all" & "clean".
	* [BUG] Typing `=' in variable name entry in Preferences window advances
	to the value entry.  This avoids the user accidentally typing `='
	in variable names.
	* [NVC] Got rid of stupid autonull hack.  Dialogs are now not destroyed when the
	user closes them with WM_DELETE.
	* [NVC] Source now also compiles with "gcc -ansi".
	* [NVC] Don't try to distribute aclocal.m4 which doesn't exist anymore.
	* [NVC] Maketool's own Makefiles now have GNU standard usage of $top_srcdir,
	$top_builddir, $pkgdatadir and $pkglibexecdir.
	* [NVC] Reduce use of @PACKAGE@ etc in spec file.
	* [NVC] Removed some RH-specific $OS stuff in spec file.
	* [NVC] Building maketool with DEBUG=n now adds -Wall and removes -O2 from $CFLAGS.
	* Building maketool RPMs no longer uses the system /usr/src/RPM directory,
	instead using --define to do everything in the local directory.  This
	enables someone without root privilege to build an RPM.
	* [NVC] Removed "Latin" translation -- have real ones to test now!
	* [NVC] Various small tweaks found by -Wall.
	* [NVC] Various code rationalisations, notably in starting child processes
	and handling their output.
	* [NVC] No longer use an objs/ directory for object files.


Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 2000  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.6.2
	* Added an option to disable make_makefile.
	* Added an option to scroll to end on make child output.
	* Added preferences option to beep, show a dialog, or run a command
	at the end of build runs.   
	* Added button to edit the first error or warning in the next file
	(thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Added command File->Edit Makefile to edit the makefile in the current
	directory; the trick is to figure out which file to edit (thanks to
	Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Added first stirrings of on-line help, temporarily disabled for release.
	* General UI improvements to Find window (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Maketool remembers previous directories in config file, not only during
	one session (thanks to Vaclav Slavik).
	* Scripts make_makefile and extract_targets now live in
	$prefix/libexec/maketool not $prefix/bin (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Removed the configure-time test for /usr/doc.  Installing the basic
	doco (COPYRIGHT etc) is now handled by RPM following a %doc directive
	in the spec file. This is a far cleaner technique.
	* Tweaked maketool logo so that the small icon looks better when
	scaled down in modern GNOME's taskbar.
	* Renamed source tarball from .tgz to .tar.gz to allow Apache to
	get the mime type right.
	* Updated copyright messages for the new millennium.
	* Pruned out obsolete and superfluous inline TODOs.
	* Fixed bug which SEGVd if make output contained empty lines.
	* Fixed bug where all dialogs did not properly handle the user closing them
	via the window manager rather than using the Close or Cancel button.
	* Fixed bug where changes to widgets in the Preferences windows were
	not forgotten when the Cancel button is pressed.
	* Fixed bug which caused GTK warnings to be printed out when a regexp
	was searched in the Find window (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Fixed harmless bug in 0.6.1 which issued spurious ioctl(FIONREAD) on
	nonexistant pipe fd for editor child processes (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
	* Fixed bug where changing any of the log flags causes the current scroll
	position in the log to be lost as the log is repopulated.
	* Fixed Solaris compile problem (thanks to David T Bath).

Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 2000  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.6.1
	* Fixed bug with glib 1.2.7 and the glib 1.2.6-7 in RH 6.2.

Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 2000  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.6
	* Initial implementation of printing the make log.  Prints to PostScript.
	Preferences entries exist (e.g. paper size, margins) but there is no GUI
	for them yet. Reads list of printers from /etc/printcap or `lpstat -c`
	(decided at configure time).
	* Initial implementation of a Find window. Still several rough edges. Can
	enter a literal or a regexp, and find or find-again. Stack of historical
	search cases, navigable with PgUp/PgDn.  No case-insensitive literals yet.
	* Implemented a File->Change Directory command, and a menu of previous
	directories.  Shows basename of current directory in main window title bar.
	* Dialogs are properly marked as transient so that the window manager
	handles them correctly.
	* Dialogs are positioned over the main window instead of letting
	the window manager choose a random and inconvenient position.
	* Rewrote the process spawning code.  This made the code a lot more
	orthogonal and also fixed a bug whereby the Stop button was broken.
	* Tooltip for Again toolbar button, and the Again menu item, now mention
	what the last target is. This avoids nasty surprises.
	* Implemented Edit->Copy command which copies the selected line to the
	clipboard.
	* Added filter support for the MWOS xcc cross-compiler.
	* Added filter support for bison.
	* Added filter support for flex.
	* Dependencies are built using makedepend rather than hardcoded.
	* Can now build debugging version using DEBUG=n on make commandline.
	* Solaris debugging & Purifying patches for Makefile.
	* NetBSD port makefile fixes.
	* configure checks for <sys/filio.h> for Solaris.
	* Worked around incompatibility with GDK/GTK 1.2.6.  I still don't know why
	this change actually matters, and I still think it's a GDK or GLIB bug,
	but for the time being this change fixes maketool. This obsoletes the
	gtk-1.2.6 patch.
	* Fixed bug introduced in the gtk-1.2.6 patch which lost the output
	of `gmake --version' when building the Help->About make dialog.
	* Fixed bug where an error message specifying an absolute pathname,
	when found in a recursive make, would result in maketool attempting
	to edit sub_dir/abs_path instead of abs_path.
	* Fixed bug which caused coredump when pressing Clear Log during
	build -- by greying out the Clear Log item.
	* Fixed alignment of labels in Preferences window.
	* Fixed a few minor warnings -Wall found.
	* Fixed bug which caused menu item greying to be done prematurely
	when child make processes were started.

Sun Nov 14 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.5.1
	* Fixed race condition which caused the first process spawned to sometimes
	not be reaped properly if it finished quickly. This sometimes lead to
	an empty Build menu.

Sun Nov 07 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.5
	* Added feature which builds a new Makefile if it is out of date. Handles
	autoconf and imake.
	* Added feature to map directory level to tree indent level.
	* Added feature to allow make variables to be overriden on the commandline.
	* Added feature where the number of errors and warnings in a build run
	or log file is displayed in the start line, updated as lines are parsed.
	* Added a small sample window showing colours & icons in the
	Colors tab of the Preferences window.
	* Added `Reset to Old' and `Reset to Defaults' buttons in the
	Colors tab of the Preferences window.
	* Added filter to detect gcc inclusion trace and allow clicking on
	those lines to edit those files.
	* Loading a long error log file now does minimal updates to the log
	window scrollbar, and issues a message beforehand.
	* The Edit Next & Edit Prev commands now scroll to the error if its
	not fully visible onscreen.
	* Added `babygnu' GNU logo to About Make window.
	* Handles makefiles with large numbers of targets (e.g. the Linux
	kernel makefile with over 50 targets which survive the extract_targets
	filter) by splitting the Build menu into multiple submenus.
	* "tags" is now considered a standard target.
	* Solaris port: include the right header to define FIONREAD. Thanks to
	Alistair Crooks.
	* Made GNU make executable name configurable. Configure now has a
	--with-gmake=CMD argument, whose value may contain a full pathname
	or name to be looked up in $PATH, and optionally flags. Thanks to
	Frederick Bruckman.
	* Configure checks for presence of /usr/doc at configure time, and if
	absent comments out targets for installation of TODO etc files.
	This makes life easier for non-Linux folks. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
	* The GPL text is compiled into the executable now, so there's no
	need for it to be installed anywhere. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
	* Fixed bug with unescaped +s in filter regexps. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
	* Fixed layout bug in General and Colors tabs of the Preferences window
	which resulted in oversized buttons.
	* Be a little bit less verbose at low values of DEBUG.
	* Fixed the bug which coredumped if editing next error in summary
	mode and next error is `   from fred.c:9:'
	* Fixed bug where after editing colours and clicking Cancel, the
	next time the Preferences window is brought up it shows the
	abandoned edited colours instead of the current colours.
	* Updated tests to exercise some previously fixed bugs.
	* Fixed bug which allowed whitespace in filenames on error lines.
	* Fixed bug where the run load spinbox in the Preferences window would
	sometimes save an incorrect value due to a float rounding problem.

Sat Sep 11 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.4
	* Added the ability to summarise lines in the make log, e.g.
	a long compile line becomes `Compiling fred.c'. Handles
	compiling C/C++, compiling Java, linking C/C++, and building
	an archive library. Error & warning lines have their initial
	part (filename & line number) removed. Also gcc-produced
	lines which are spurious in the maketool context are removed entirely.
	* Added a dryrun option.
	* Log flags are saved to preferences.
	* Preferences now include foreground and background colors for
	info, error, and warning lines. Saved into ~/.maketoolrc.
	* Fixed bug where Variables list in Preferences window got confused
	after user sets the same variable to two different values.
	* Fixed estring bug which caused Purify error if estring
	is used after estring_free().
	* Fixed bug which mis-handled the last line of a child process'
	output or a logfile if the line wasn't terminated with \n.
	* Fixed bug which leaked the key of a config string which
	was set for the 2nd or subsequent time.
	* Made a debugging print properly conditional.
	* Made the sinclude()s in configure.in use full path names so that
	autoconf does not need to be invoked with any arguments. Now I
	don't need the special configure: make target.
	* Rationalised code which puts version number into about string.
	* Removed as many line length/buffer overflow conditions as
	I could find. Tested with a line longer than 1024 chars.


Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.3
	* The Licence button now pops up a window which
	shows the GPL in a text widget. Text is loaded
	at runtime from the installed doc dir.
	* All dialogs are titled "Maketool: foo"
	* Added --version option.
	* Implemented the following arguments with gmake's syntax:
	-C --directory -f --file --makefile -h, --help -j --jobs -k
	--keep-going  -l --load-average --max-load -S --no-keep-going
	--stop -v --version
	* Fixed bugs which broke compile on systems which need
	the included gettext.
	* Makefile no longer needs separate $run_prefix.
	* Preferences and window size are loaded on startup and saved
	when changed, in the file ~/.maketoolrc.
	* Fixed various minor bugs.
	* Removed the test initial values of variables in the Preferences.
	* No longer relies on OS having poll(2).
	* Added accelerators.
	* Toolbar and menubar are now dockable (in a limited way).
	* Main window can resize down vertically.
	* aclocal.m4 is much neater now.
	* Moved icons and test stuff into their own directories.
	* Split the View menu into View and Edit menus.
	* Refined extract_targets heuristics a little.
	* All C converted to GNU-standard identifiers.
	* Added a `Stop' button to the toolbar.
	* Improved detection of GNU standard targets. Now detects all
	the standard targets mentioned in the doc.
	* Toolbar icons are a lot less subtle in colour, so that their
	insensitive state can be easily distinguished.

Sat Jun 06 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.2   (1 Jun 1999)
	* First public release.

Wed May 05 00:00:00 1999  Greg Banks <gnb@alphalink.com.au>
	* Release 0.1
	* Started work.
