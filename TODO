   of the View menu items into it.

x  GNOME integration: drag'n'drop. Dragging in directory changes to
   that directory. Dragging in file or string makes it if it's a known
   target. Otherwise, if the MIMEtype indicates its text, open it as 
   a log file. Dragging out a log line is a filename or file+line.

x  GNOME integration: session management. Save directory & last target
   and state of errs/warnings/info toggles. Load again when started
   by session manager.
   
x  GNOME integration: dockable menubar, statusbar, and toolbar. Also
   neato icons in menus.

x  Use getopt?

x  DONE: Remove those irritating variable values from the Preferences window.

x  Fix bug whereby `configure --with-included-gettext' leaves a symlink
   intl/libintl.h -> intl/libgettext.h which is not removed again when
   re-configured and causes other builds to break with `symbol dcgettext__
   not found'.
   
x  On startup, when preferences or args specify a non-existant makefile,
   issue a warning alert to the user.
   
x  DONE: Fix bug whereby run load spinbox saves wrong value to preferences.
   It was a float rounding problem.
   
x  Add filters to summarise compile lines, and a View menu item

   menu, when makefile changes.
   
x  DONE: Fix bug which loses last line of child process' output if the
   line doesn't end in a '\n' (worse, it prepends that to the output
   of the next child process).
   
x  Change the preferences so that the actual make executable used is
   specified in exactly one place instead of three (prog_make,
   prog_make_version, and inside the shell script extract_targets).
   Use %M as the name of the executable in those cases.
   
x  DONE: Allow setting of make variables using VAR=val syntax on command line.

x  Make the default text editor configurable, figured out in configure.

x  DONE: Loading a large make log does way too much updating of the scrollbar.

x  DONE: use a GNU logo in the `Help->About make' dialog.

x  When loading log file, should report number of errors & warnings.

x  DONE: Edit Next Error command should make the newly line visible by scrolling.

x  In summary mode, need to highlight the `Compiling' lines visually to
   separate them from the usual make clutter.

x  Should be able to drag & drop {filename, linenumber, message} or text.

x  For the editing program, should be able to specify a %sequence which
   contains the quoted error message, for integration with IDEs.

x  An error message which specifies an absolute pathname /abs/path tries
   to open file /curr/dir/abs/path instead of /abs/path
   
x  Add ability to delete individual make runs from view window

   Preferences window.
   
x  Provide a Preferences setting to control what happens when a make
   run finishes. Nothing; Sound Bell; Flash Window; Run Program.

   or file modification time for log files. Also number of errors & warnings.

x  DONE: Should be able to edit main.c by clicking on "    from main.c" in gcc
   inclusion trace.

x  Provide facility to search the log text.

x  Fix bug where sometimes list_targets doesn't finish, or isn't reaped,
   or something.
