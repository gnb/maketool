   that directory. Dragging in file or string makes it if it's a known
   target. Otherwise, if the MIMEtype indicates its text, open it as 
   a log file. Dragging out a log line is a filename or file+line.

   and state of errs/warnings/info toggles. Load again when started
   by session manager.

x  Fix bug whereby `configure --with-included-gettext' leaves a symlink
   intl/libintl.h -> intl/libgettext.h which is not removed again when
   re-configured and causes other builds to break with `symbol dcgettext__
   not found'.

   specified in exactly one place instead of three (prog_make,

x  Allow setting of make variables using VAR=val syntax on command line.

x  Make the default text editor configurable, figured out in configure.
