x  The Licence button now pops up a window which
   shows the GPL in a text widget. Text is loaded
   at runtime from the installed doc dir.
x  All dialogs are titled "Maketool: foo"
x  Added --version option.
x  Implemented the following arguments with gmake's syntax:
   -C --directory -f --file --makefile -h, --help -j --jobs -k
   --keep-going  -l --load-average --max-load -S --no-keep-going
   --stop -v --version
x  Fixed bugs which broke compile on systems which need
   the included gettext.
x  Makefile no longer needs separate $run_prefix.
x  Preferences and window size are loaded on startup and saved
   when changed, in the file ~/.maketoolrc.
x  Fixed various minor bugs.
x  Removed the test initial values of variables in the Preferences.
x  No longer relies on OS having poll(2).

x  aclocal.m4 is much neater now.
x  Moved icons and test stuff into their own directories.
x  Split the View menu into View and Edit menus.
x  Refined extract_targets heuristics a little.
x  All C converted to GNU-standard identifiers.
x  Added a `Stop' button to the toolbar.
x  Improved detection of GNU standard targets. Now detects all
   the standard targets mentioned in the doc.

   insensitive state can be easily distinguished.
