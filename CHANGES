* 0.7  (28 Sep 2001)
x  [FEA] There is now a GUI for choosing options to ./configure scripts when
   building a Makefile in directories which use autoconf.
x  [FEA] Added support for automake.
x  [FEA] Added a menu item to allow the user to manually rebuild the Makefile
   when using autoconf, automake or imake.
x  [FEA] Added menu items to run configure, run autoconf, etc.
x  [FEA] Added filters to recognise configure script's "creating" lines, so the user
   can double-click on those lines.
x  [FEA] The make_makefile program has been replaced, partly with in-process
   code, partly with several fixed Makefile fragments.  Automatically
   building the Makefile is now much cleaner and more reliable.
x  [FEA] In summarise mode, summarised lines are shown in a configurable colour,
   which defaults to a very light grey.  This shows where the "Compiling"
   etc lines are when there is lots of un-summarisable rubbish.
x  [FEA] Added support for summaries of cross-compilation and cross-linking.
x  [FEA] Japanese translation, thanks to SATO Satoru of the Japan GNOME Users Group.
x  [FEA] Added Czech translation (thanks to Vaclav Slavik).
x  [FEA] No longer depends on BSD signal semantics; instead BSD and SysV semantics
   are checked for at configure time.
x  [FEA] The binary RPM now depends on make.
x  [FEA] Add email address to Vendor: in spec file.
x  [FEA] Correct GNOME-like appearance and behaviour of buttons in dialogs.
x  [FEA] Considerable work on the documentation, which is not released yet.
x  [BUG] Widgets update (e.g. mouse-over animations) during help click-on sequence.
x  [BUG] Fixed bug which broke summaries of some compile lines.
x  [BUG] Improved failure mode when extract_targets is not found: a single
   insensitive menu entry is added, and the error output is shown to
   the user in the message bar.
x  [BUG] Work around problem with mouse-over highlights of toolbar "all" & "clean".
x  [BUG] Typing `=' in variable name entry in Preferences window advances
   to the value entry.  This avoids the user accidentally typing `='
   in variable names.
x  [NVC] Got rid of stupid autonull hack.  Dialogs are now not destroyed when the
   user closes them with WM_DELETE.
x  [NVC] Source now also compiles with "gcc -ansi".
x  [NVC] Don't try to distribute aclocal.m4 which doesn't exist anymore.
x  [NVC] Maketool's own Makefiles now have GNU standard usage of $top_srcdir,
   $top_builddir, $pkgdatadir and $pkglibexecdir.
x  [NVC] Reduce use of @PACKAGE@ etc in spec file.
x  [NVC] Removed some RH-specific $OS stuff in spec file.
x  [NVC] Building maketool with DEBUG=n now adds -Wall and removes -O2 from $CFLAGS.
x  Building maketool RPMs no longer uses the system /usr/src/RPM directory,
   instead using --define to do everything in the local directory.  This
   enables someone without root privilege to build an RPM.
x  [NVC] Removed "Latin" translation -- have real ones to test now!
x  [NVC] Various small tweaks found by -Wall.
x  [NVC] Various code rationalisations, notably in starting child processes
   and handling their output.
x  [NVC] No longer use an objs/ directory for object files.


* 0.6.2  (26 Nov 2000)
x  Added an option to disable make_makefile.
x  Added an option to scroll to end on make child output.
x  Added preferences option to beep, show a dialog, or run a command
   at the end of build runs.   
x  Added button to edit the first error or warning in the next file
   (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Added command File->Edit Makefile to edit the makefile in the current
   directory; the trick is to figure out which file to edit (thanks to
   Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Added first stirrings of on-line help, temporarily disabled for release.
x  General UI improvements to Find window (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Maketool remembers previous directories in config file, not only during
   one session (thanks to Vaclav Slavik).
x  Scripts make_makefile and extract_targets now live in
   $prefix/libexec/maketool not $prefix/bin (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Removed the configure-time test for /usr/doc.  Installing the basic
   doco (COPYRIGHT etc) is now handled by RPM following a %doc directive
   in the spec file. This is a far cleaner technique.
x  Tweaked maketool logo so that the small icon looks better when
   scaled down in modern GNOME's taskbar.
x  Renamed source tarball from .tgz to .tar.gz to allow Apache to
   get the mime type right.
x  Updated copyright messages for the new millennium.
x  Pruned out obsolete and superfluous inline TODOs.
x  Fixed bug which SEGVd if make output contained empty lines.
x  Fixed bug where all dialogs did not properly handle the user closing them
   via the window manager rather than using the Close or Cancel button.
x  Fixed bug where changes to widgets in the Preferences windows were
   not forgotten when the Cancel button is pressed.
x  Fixed bug which caused GTK warnings to be printed out when a regexp
   was searched in the Find window (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Fixed harmless bug in 0.6.1 which issued spurious ioctl(FIONREAD) on
   nonexistant pipe fd for editor child processes (thanks to Albert T Hofkamp).
x  Fixed bug where changing any of the log flags causes the current scroll
   position in the log to be lost as the log is repopulated.
x  Fixed Solaris compile problem (thanks to David T Bath).

* 0.6.1  (19 Jul 2000)
x  Fixed bug with glib 1.2.7 and the glib 1.2.6-7 in RH 6.2.

* 0.6  (13 Jul 2000)
x  Initial implementation of printing the make log.  Prints to PostScript.
   Preferences entries exist (e.g. paper size, margins) but there is no GUI
   for them yet. Reads list of printers from /etc/printcap or `lpstat -c`
   (decided at configure time).
x  Initial implementation of a Find window. Still several rough edges. Can
   enter a literal or a regexp, and find or find-again. Stack of historical
   search cases, navigable with PgUp/PgDn.  No case-insensitive literals yet.
x  Implemented a File->Change Directory command, and a menu of previous
   directories.  Shows basename of current directory in main window title bar.
x  Dialogs are properly marked as transient so that the window manager
   handles them correctly.
x  Dialogs are positioned over the main window instead of letting
   the window manager choose a random and inconvenient position.
x  Rewrote the process spawning code.  This made the code a lot more
   orthogonal and also fixed a bug whereby the Stop button was broken.
x  Tooltip for Again toolbar button, and the Again menu item, now mention
   what the last target is. This avoids nasty surprises.
x  Implemented Edit->Copy command which copies the selected line to the
   clipboard.
x  Added filter support for the MWOS xcc cross-compiler.
x  Added filter support for bison.
x  Added filter support for flex.
x  Dependencies are built using makedepend rather than hardcoded.
x  Can now build debugging version using DEBUG=n on make commandline.
x  Solaris debugging & Purifying patches for Makefile.
x  NetBSD port makefile fixes.
x  configure checks for <sys/filio.h> for Solaris.
x  Worked around incompatibility with GDK/GTK 1.2.6.  I still don't know why
   this change actually matters, and I still think it's a GDK or GLIB bug,
   but for the time being this change fixes maketool. This obsoletes the
   gtk-1.2.6 patch.
x  Fixed bug introduced in the gtk-1.2.6 patch which lost the output
   of `gmake --version' when building the Help->About make dialog.
x  Fixed bug where an error message specifying an absolute pathname,
   when found in a recursive make, would result in maketool attempting
   to edit sub_dir/abs_path instead of abs_path.
x  Fixed bug which caused coredump when pressing Clear Log during
   build -- by greying out the Clear Log item.
x  Fixed alignment of labels in Preferences window.
x  Fixed a few minor warnings -Wall found.
x  Fixed bug which caused menu item greying to be done prematurely
   when child make processes were started.


* 0.5.1  (14 Nov 1999)
x  Fixed race condition which caused the first process spawned to sometimes
   not be reaped properly if it finished quickly. This sometimes lead to
   an empty Build menu.

* 0.5  (07 Nov 1999)
x  Added feature which builds a new Makefile if it is out of date. Handles
   autoconf and imake.
x  Added feature to map directory level to tree indent level.
x  Added feature to allow make variables to be overriden on the commandline.
x  Added feature where the number of errors and warnings in a build run
   or log file is displayed in the start line, updated as lines are parsed.
x  Added a small sample window showing colours & icons in the
   Colors tab of the Preferences window.
x  Added `Reset to Old' and `Reset to Defaults' buttons in the
   Colors tab of the Preferences window.
x  Added filter to detect gcc inclusion trace and allow clicking on
   those lines to edit those files.
x  Loading a long error log file now does minimal updates to the log
   window scrollbar, and issues a message beforehand.
x  The Edit Next & Edit Prev commands now scroll to the error if its
   not fully visible onscreen.
x  Added `babygnu' GNU logo to About Make window.
x  Handles makefiles with large numbers of targets (e.g. the Linux
   kernel makefile with over 50 targets which survive the extract_targets
   filter) by splitting the Build menu into multiple submenus.
x  "tags" is now considered a standard target.
x  Solaris port: include the right header to define FIONREAD. Thanks to
   Alistair Crooks.
x  Made GNU make executable name configurable. Configure now has a
   --with-gmake=CMD argument, whose value may contain a full pathname
   or name to be looked up in $PATH, and optionally flags. Thanks to
   Frederick Bruckman.
x  Configure checks for presence of /usr/doc at configure time, and if
   absent comments out targets for installation of TODO etc files.
   This makes life easier for non-Linux folks. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
x  The GPL text is compiled into the executable now, so there's no
   need for it to be installed anywhere. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
x  Fixed bug with unescaped +s in filter regexps. Thanks to Frederick Bruckman.
x  Fixed layout bug in General and Colors tabs of the Preferences window
   which resulted in oversized buttons.
x  Be a little bit less verbose at low values of DEBUG.
x  Fixed the bug which coredumped if editing next error in summary
   mode and next error is `   from fred.c:9:'
x  Fixed bug where after editing colours and clicking Cancel, the
   next time the Preferences window is brought up it shows the
   abandoned edited colours instead of the current colours.
x  Updated tests to exercise some previously fixed bugs.
x  Fixed bug which allowed whitespace in filenames on error lines.
x  Fixed bug where the run load spinbox in the Preferences window would
   sometimes save an incorrect value due to a float rounding problem.


* 0.4  (11 Sep 1999)
x  Added the ability to summarise lines in the make log, e.g.
   a long compile line becomes `Compiling fred.c'. Handles
   compiling C/C++, compiling Java, linking C/C++, and building
   an archive library. Error & warning lines have their initial
   part (filename & line number) removed. Also gcc-produced
   lines which are spurious in the maketool context are removed entirely.
x  Added a dryrun option.
x  Log flags are saved to preferences.
x  Preferences now include foreground and background colors for
   info, error, and warning lines. Saved into ~/.maketoolrc.
x  Fixed bug where Variables list in Preferences window got confused
   after user sets the same variable to two different values.
x  Fixed estring bug which caused Purify error if estring
   is used after estring_free().
x  Fixed bug which mis-handled the last line of a child process'
   output or a logfile if the line wasn't terminated with \n.
x  Fixed bug which leaked the key of a config string which
   was set for the 2nd or subsequent time.
x  Made a debugging print properly conditional.
x  Made the sinclude()s in configure.in use full path names so that
   autoconf does not need to be invoked with any arguments. Now I
   don't need the special configure: make target.
x  Rationalised code which puts version number into about string.
x  Removed as many line length/buffer overflow conditions as
   I could find. Tested with a line longer than 1024 chars.


* 0.3  (14 Jul 1999)
x  The Licence button now pops up a window which
   shows the GPL in a text widget. Text is loaded
   at runtime from the installed doc dir.
x  All dialogs are titled "Maketool: foo"
x  Added --version option.
x  Implemented the following arguments with gmake's syntax:
   -C --directory -f --file --makefile -h, --help -j --jobs -k
   --keep-going  -l --load-average --max-load -S --no-keep-going
   --stop -v --version
x  Fixed bugs which broke compile on systems which need
   the included gettext.
x  Makefile no longer needs separate $run_prefix.
x  Preferences and window size are loaded on startup and saved
   when changed, in the file ~/.maketoolrc.
x  Fixed various minor bugs.
x  Removed the test initial values of variables in the Preferences.
x  No longer relies on OS having poll(2).
x  Added accelerators.
x  Toolbar and menubar are now dockable (in a limited way).
x  Main window can resize down vertically.
x  aclocal.m4 is much neater now.
x  Moved icons and test stuff into their own directories.
x  Split the View menu into View and Edit menus.
x  Refined extract_targets heuristics a little.
x  All C converted to GNU-standard identifiers.
x  Added a `Stop' button to the toolbar.
x  Improved detection of GNU standard targets. Now detects all
   the standard targets mentioned in the doc.
x  Toolbar icons are a lot less subtle in colour, so that their
   insensitive state can be easily distinguished.


* 0.2   (1 Jun 1999)
x  First public release.

* 0.1  (14 May 1999)
x  Started work.
