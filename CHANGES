* 0.4  (11 Sep 1999)
x  Added the ability to summarise lines in the make log, e.g.
   a long compile line becomes `Compiling fred.c'. Handles
   compiling C/C++, compiling Java, linking C/C++, and building
   an archive library. Error & warning lines have their initial
   part (filename & line number) removed. Also gcc-produced
   lines which are spurious in the maketool context are removed entirely.
x  Added a dryrun option.
x  Log flags are saved to preferences.
x  Preferences now include foreground and background colors for
   info, error, and warning lines. Saved into ~/.maketoolrc.
x  Fixed bug where Variables list in Preferences window got confused
   after user sets the same variable to two different values.
x  Fixed estring bug which caused Purify error if estring
   is used after estring_free().
x  Fixed bug which mis-handled the last line of a child process'
   output or a logfile if the line wasn't terminated with \n.
x  Fixed bug which leaked the key of a config string which
   was set for the 2nd or subsequent time.
x  Made a debugging print properly conditional.
x  Made the sinclude()s in configure.in use full path names so that
   autoconf does not need to be invoked with any arguments. Now I
   don't need the special configure: make target.
x  Rationalised code which puts version number into about string.
x  Removed as many line length/buffer overflow conditions as
   I could find. Tested with a line longer than 1024 chars.


* 0.3  (14 Jul 1999)
x  The Licence button now pops up a window which
   shows the GPL in a text widget. Text is loaded
   at runtime from the installed doc dir.
x  All dialogs are titled "Maketool: foo"
x  Added --version option.
x  Implemented the following arguments with gmake's syntax:
   -C --directory -f --file --makefile -h, --help -j --jobs -k
   --keep-going  -l --load-average --max-load -S --no-keep-going
   --stop -v --version
x  Fixed bugs which broke compile on systems which need
   the included gettext.
x  Makefile no longer needs separate $run_prefix.
x  Preferences and window size are loaded on startup and saved
   when changed, in the file ~/.maketoolrc.
x  Fixed various minor bugs.
x  Removed the test initial values of variables in the Preferences.
x  No longer relies on OS having poll(2).
x  Added accelerators.
x  Toolbar and menubar are now dockable (in a limited way).
x  Main window can resize down vertically.
x  aclocal.m4 is much neater now.
x  Moved icons and test stuff into their own directories.
x  Split the View menu into View and Edit menus.
x  Refined extract_targets heuristics a little.
x  All C converted to GNU-standard identifiers.
x  Added a `Stop' button to the toolbar.
x  Improved detection of GNU standard targets. Now detects all
   the standard targets mentioned in the doc.
x  Toolbar icons are a lot less subtle in colour, so that their
   insensitive state can be easily distinguished.
