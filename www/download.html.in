<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#ff0000>URGENT NEWS</FONT> The 0.6 release
has proved to have major problems working with gtk-1.2.7 and
the gtk-1.2.6-7 in RedHat 6.2.  I'm working on the problem and
will have a patch and new release ready as soon as I can.

I have personally ported a version of maketool to Solaris, but as I
have no regular access to a Solaris machine, I am
unable to point to any binaries (sorry). The latest source includes Solaris
port patches.
