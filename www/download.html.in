There used to be a link to Debian packages here, but that page
seems to have disappeared.  I'd be happy to hear about anyone
creating Debian packages for maketool.

<P>
I have personally ported a version of maketool to Solaris, but as I
have no regular access to a Solaris machine, I am
unable to point to any binaries (sorry). The latest source includes Solaris
port patches.
