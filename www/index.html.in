<P>
Maketool is a simple GTK+ based GUI front end for GNU make.
It is released under GPL with <B>no warranty</B>.
</P>

<P>
Maketool's features include:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Figures out what targets are available and presents them in a menu.
  <LI>Runs make and detects compiler errors and warnings in the output.
  <LI>Double-clicking on errors starts an editor with that file and line.
  <LI>Works with any makefile system that uses GNU make.
  <LI>Automatically updates Makefile if project uses autoconf or imake.
  <LI>Special handling for standard GNU targets such as <I>all</I>,
      <I>install</I>, <I>clean</I> etc.
  <LI>Save and reload logs of make runs.
  <LI>Summarise make logs to reduce visual clutter.
  <LI>With recursive make, expand or collapse each directory separately
  <LI>Override values of make and environment variables.
  <LI>Make in series or in parallel, (using make's -j and -l flags).
  <LI>Dryrun mode (using make's -n flag).
  <LI>Implements many of make's command-line options.
  <LI>Configure foreground & background colours of error & warnings lines.
</UL>

<P>
I personally test maketool on these platforms:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>RedHat Linux 5.2 on i386
</UL>
<P>
I have received reports of maketool running on these platforms:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Slackware Linux 3.5
  <LI>NetBSD
  <LI>Solaris
</UL>
<P>
If you port maketool to a new platform, please EMAILME(mail me) the
patches (unified diff `format' preferred). I will try to incorporate them
into the next release.  I'm also interested in translations into new languages.
</P>
