<p>
Maketool is a simple GTK+ based GUI front end for GNU make and
other make programs.  It is released under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
with <b>no warranty</b>.
</p>

<p>
Maketool's features include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figures out what targets are available and presents them in a menu.
  <li>Runs make and detects compiler errors and warnings in the output.
  <li>Double-clicking on errors starts an editor with that file and line.
  <li>Works with any makefile system that uses GNU make.
  <li>Automatically updates Makefile if project uses automake, autoconf or imake.
  <li>GUI for selecting configure options for automake and autoconf.
  <li>Special handling for standard GNU targets such as <i>all</i>,
      <i>install</i>, <i>clean</i> etc.
  <li>Save and reload logs of make runs.
  <li>Summarise make logs to reduce visual clutter.
  <li>With recursive make, expand or collapse each directory separately
  <li>Override values of make and environment variables.
  <li>Make in series or in parallel, (using make's -j and -l flags).
  <li>Dryrun mode (using make's -n flag).
  <li>Implements many of make's command-line options.
  <li>Configure foreground &amp; background colours of error &amp; warnings lines.
  <li>Now also supports Solaris make, IRIX smake, and BSD pmake.
</ul>

<p>
I personally test maketool on these platforms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>RedHat Linux 7.3 on i386
  <li>RedHat Linux 9 on i386
  <li>IRIX 6.5.x on MIPS
  <li>SGI ProPack Linux on ia64
</ul>
<p>
I have received reports of maketool running on these platforms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debian Linux
  <li>Mandrake Linux 9.2
  <li>Slackware Linux 3.5
  <li>NetBSD
  <li>FreeBSD
  <li>Solaris
</ul>
<p>
If you port maketool to a new platform, please EMAILME(mail me) the
patches (unified diff `format' preferred). I will try to incorporate them
into the next release.  I'm also interested in translations into new languages.
